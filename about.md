NestNinja Hub is the **community discovery platform** for [NestNinja](https://nestninja.uk) smart bird box cameras.

It allows NestNinja device owners to **optionally share** their live camera feeds so other bird watchers can browse and watch nesting activity from around the UK.

---

## Principles

**Privacy first** — camera owners must explicitly opt in to having their feed listed. Nothing is shared without consent.

**Client-side only** — Hub is a lightweight static site with no server-side compute. All data comes from a real-time database (Firebase or equivalent).

**No lock-in** — feeds can be de-listed instantly from the NestNinja device settings.

**Free to browse** — no account, no sign-up required to watch community feeds.

## Status

Hub is currently **planned but not yet in development.** Architecture decisions will be defined via ADRs before implementation begins.

Core NestNinja firmware development takes priority (targeting late 2026).
